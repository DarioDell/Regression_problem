# Regression_problem
This paper focuses on a regression analysis task whereby it is required to predict the price of diamonds.

Upon cleaning and processing the data, I shall go ahead and build and then develop, the model in search of the best. In the case of the target variable, it assumes a continuous, infinite numerical value; therefore, I consider this problem to be a regression type.

First of all, I will try to apply Simple Linear Regression and then gradually to incorporate other variables into the model. In addition, I will also incorporate the Ridge and Lasso regularization methods in my model with the hope of achieving improved outcomes.

Finally, in order to compare the results of the model, that is, the predictions, with the real values ​​and thus evaluate the model: The evaluation of the performance of the model will be evaluated by the following mathematical values: Mean square error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Determination coefficient (R2).
